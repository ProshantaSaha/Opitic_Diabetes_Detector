This file provides an overview of the deep inspect agent implemented in
python to extract values of Scale file user-defined attributes and assign
those values to Discover tags with the same suffic.

SUMMARY
This example of a Discover action/deep inspect agent extracts Spectrum Scale
user-defined attributes from files that the Discover appliance has access to.

This example extracts the value of user=defined Scale attribute of the form
"user.mlproject" and assigns that value to the Discover tag "mlproject."
The tags to receive values are defined by the Discover deep inspect policy
associated with the scale_agent.py agent.

CONFIGURING SCALE AGENT

1. Using the Discover UI, create the tags with names corresponding to the
suffix (i.e., string after "user.") of Scale user-defined attributes of files
to be processed.  Note that these tag names are to be supplied to the policy
in the extract_tags list.

2. Specify the environment specific variables as shown in sourceme.
Note the AGENT_NAME (uprojectagent) will be registered with Discover and,
subsequently, visible in the Agent listing in the Discover UI.

3. In the Discover UI, navigate to the Metadata pane and select the Policies
tab. Add the policy "uprojectpolicy," specifying:
  A. that it is a DEEPINSPECT type policy
  B. Agent name matches environment variable AGENT_NAME as defined in the
     sourceme file.
  C. Parameter is "extract_tags"
  D. Value is the list of tag names.

4. Execute the deep inspect agent on a Scale node running as user with
sufficient privilege to execute Scale mm* commands, etc.
   # ./scale_agent.py > scale_agent.log 2>&1 &

5. In the Discover UI, navigate to the Policies tab in Metadata, and run the
policy by selecting the "start" icon in the policy management bar.
